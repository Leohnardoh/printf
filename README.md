# _printf :page_facing_up:

A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level
programming and algorithm track at ALX . The program is a pseudo-
recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

## Dependencies :couple:

The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

## Usage :running:

To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
any main function.

Example `main.c`:
```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!");

        return (0);
	}
	```

	Compilation:
	```
	$ gcc *.c -o tester
	```

	Output:
	```
	$ ./tester
	Hello, World!
	$
	```

	## Description :speech_balloon:

	The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
	under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
	(accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
	converted for output.

	Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

	### Return Value

	Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
	(excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
	output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

	### Format of the Argument String

	The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
	or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
	to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
	fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
	introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
	between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
	zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
	_precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
	with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

	#### Flag Characters

	The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

	#### #
	  * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
	    with `0` if it was not zero already.
	      * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
	        * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

		Example `main.c`:
		```
		int main(void)
		{
		    _printf("%#x\n", 7);
		    }
		    ```
		    Output:
		    ```
		    0x7
		    ```

		    #### (space)
		      * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
		        signed conversion.

			Example `main.c`:
			```
			int main(void)
			{
			    _printf("% d\n", 7);
			    }
			    ```
			    Output:
			    ```
			     7
			     ```

			     #### +
			       * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
			         conversion.
				   * Overrides a space flag.

				   Example `main.c`:
				   ```
				   int main(void)
				   {
				       _printf("%+d\n", 7);
				       }
				       ```
				       Output:
				       ```
				       +7
				       ```

				       #### 0
				         * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
					   padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
					     * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
					       precision, it is ignored.

					       Example `main.c`:
					       ```
					       int main(void)
					       {
					           _printf("%05d\n", 7);
						   }
						   ```
						   Output:
						   ```
						   00007
						   ```

						   #### -
						     * The converted value is left-justified (padded on the right with blanks
						       instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
						         * Overrides a `0` flag.

							 Example `main.c`:
							 ```
							 int main(void)
							 {
							     _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
							     }
							     ```
							     Output:
							     ```
							     7    7
							     ```

							     #### Field Width

							     After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
							     The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
							     than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
							     (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

							     Example `main.c`:
							     ```
							     int main(void)
							     {
							         _printf("%7d\n", 7);
								 }
								 ```
								 Ouptut:
								 ```
								       7
								       ```

								       Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
								       For example, in the following:
								       `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
								       the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

								       #### Precision

								       After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
								       followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
								       conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
								       For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
								       to be printed.

								       Example `main.c`:
								       ```
								       int main(void)
								       {
								           _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
									   }
									   ```
									   Output:
									   ```
									   0000007
									   ```

									   Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
									   after the `.`. For example, in the following:
									   `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
									   the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
									   `1`.

									   #### Length Modifiers

									   After flags, width, and precision and before %s\n", "Hello, World!");
									   }
									   ```
									   Output:
									   ```
									   Hello, World!
									   ```

									   #### S
									   Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
									   in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
									   as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
									   characters).

									   Example `main.c`:
									   ```
									   int main(void)
									   {
									       _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");
									       }
									       ```
									       Output:
									       ```
									       Hello, World! \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
									       ```

									       r
									       Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characters from the array
									       are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
									       byte (`\0`) and ending at the first element of the array.

									       Example `main.c`:
									       ```
									       int main(void)
									       {
									           _printf("r\n", "Hello, World");
										   }
										   ```
										   Output:
										   ```
										   dlroW ,olleH
										   ```

										   #### R

										   Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
										   is converted to its corres:black_nib:

															```
															int main(void)
															{
															    _printf("%d\n", 7);
															    }
															    ```
															    Output:
															    ```
															    7
															    ```

															    #### b

																used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversionsrray and ending at, but not including, the
																terminating null byte (`\0`).

																Example `main.c`:
																```
																int main(void)
																{
																    _printf("ponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																	}
																	```
																	Output:
																	```
																	Uryyb, Jbeyq
																	```

																	#### p
																	The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																	with a leading `0x`.

																																										## Dependencies :couple:

																																										The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																										## Usage :running:

																																										To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
																																										compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
																																										any main function.

																																										Example `main.c`:
																																										```
																																										#include "main.h"

																																										int main(void)
																																										{
																																										    _printf("Hello, World!");

																																										        return (0);
																																											}
																																											```

																																											```
																																											$ gcc *.c -o tester
																																											```

																																											Output:
																																											```
																																											$ ./tester
																																											Hello, World!
																																											$
																																											```

																																											## Description :speech_balloon:

																																											The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																											under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																											(accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																											converted for output.

																																											Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																											### Return Value

																																											Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																											(excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																											output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																											### Format of the Argument String

																																											The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																											or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																											to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																											fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																											introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																											between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																											zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																											_precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspa conversion specifier, one of the
																																											following length modifiers may be provided:

																																											#### h
																																											Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																											`unsigned short int` argument.

																																											Example `main.c`:
																																											```
																																											int main(void)
																																											{
																																											    _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_MAX);
																																											    }
																																											    ```
																																											    Output:
																																											    ```
																																											    32767
																																											    ```

																																											    #### l
																																											    Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																											    `unsigned long int` argument.

																																											    Example `main.c`:
																																											    ```
																																											    int main(void)
																																											    {
																																											        _printf("%ld\n", LONG_MAX);
																																												}
																																												```
																																												Output:
																																												```
																																												9223372036854775807
																																												```

																																												#### Conversion Specifiers

																																												The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																												specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																												supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																												#### d, i
																																												The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																												Example `main.c`:
																																												```
																																												int main(void)
																																												{
																																												    _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																												    }
																																												    ```
																																												    Output:
																																												    ```
																																												    7
																																												    ```

																																												    #### b
																																												    The `unsigned int` argument is coponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																												    Example `main.c`:
																																												    ```
																																												    int main(void)
																																												    {
																																												        _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																													}
																																													```
																																													Output:
																																													```
																																													Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																													```

																																													#### p
																																													The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																													with a leading `0x`.

																																													Example `main.c`:
																																													```
																																													int main(void)
																																													{
																																													    char *str = "Hello, World";

																																													        _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																														}
																																														```
																																														Output:
																																														```
																																														0x561a6d7bab5d
																																														```

																																														#### %
																																														A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																														specification is `%%`.

																																														Example:
																																														```
																																														int main(void)
																																														{
																																														    _printf("%%\n");
																																														    }
																																														    ```
																																														    Output:
																																														    ```

																																																																								 ```
																																																																								 $ ./tester
																																																																								 Hello, World!
																																																																								 $
																																																																								 ```

																																																																								 ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																								 The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																								 under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																								 (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																								 converted for output.

																																																																								 Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																								 ### Return Value

																																																																								 Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																								 (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																								 output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																																																								 ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																								 T int` argument.

																																																																								 Example `main.c`:
																																																																								 ```
																																																																								 int main(void)
																																																																								 {
																																																																								     _printf("%ld\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																								     }
																																																																								     ```
																																																																								     Output:
																																																																								     ```
																																																																								     9223372036854775807
																																																																								     ```

																																																																								     #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																								     The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																								     specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																								     supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																								     #### d, i
																																																																								     The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																								     Example `main.c`:
																																																																								     ```
																																																																								     int main(void)
																																																																								     {
																																																																								         _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																									 }
																																																																									 ```
																																																																									 Output:
																																																																									 ```
																																																																									 7
																																																																									 ```

																																																																									 #### b
																																																																									 The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																									 Example `main.c`:
																																																																									 ```
																																																																									 int main(void)
																																																																									 {
																																																																									     _printf("%b\n", 7);
																																																																									     }
																																																																									     ```
																																																																									     Output:
																																																																									     ```
																																																																									     111
																																																																									     ```

																																																																									     #### o, u, x, X
																																																																									     The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																									     decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																									     used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversionsard library
																																																																									     function `printf`. This README borrows from the Linux man page
																																																																									     [printf(3)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf).d! \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
																																																																									     ```

																																																																									     r
																																																																									     Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characters from the array
																																																																									     are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
																																																																									     byte (`\0`) and ending at the first element of the array.

																																																																									     Example `main.c`:
																																																																									     ```
																																																																									     int main(void)
																																																																									     {
																																																																									         _printf("r\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																										 }
																																																																										 ```
																																																																										 Output:
																																																																										 ```
																																																																										 dlroW ,olleH
																																																																										 ```

																																																																										 #### R

																																																																										 Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
																																																																										 is converted to its corresponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																																																										 Example `main.c`:
																																																																										 ```
																																																																										 int main(void)
																																																																										 {
																																																																										     _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																										     }
																																																																										     ```
																																																																										     Output:
																																																																										     ```
																																																																										     Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																										     ```

																																																																										     #### p
																																																																										     The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																										     with a leading `0x`.

																																																																										     Example `main.c`:
																																																																										     ```
																																																																										     int main(void)
																																																																										     {oid)
																																																																										     {
																																																																										         _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																											 }
																																																																											 ```
																																																																											 Output:
																																																																											 ```
																																																																											 00007
																																																																											 ```

																																																																											 #### -
																																																																											   * The converted value is left-justified (padded.

																																																																											   Example `main.c`:
																																																																											   ```
																																																																											   int main(void)
																																																																											   {
																																																																											       _printf("%o\n", 77);
																																																																											       }
																																																																											       ```
																																																																											       Output:
																																																																											       ```
																																																																											       115
																																																																											       ```

																																																																											       #### c
																																																																											       The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`.

																																																																											       Example `main.c`:
																																																																											       ```
																																																																											       int main(void)
																																																																											       {
																																																																											           _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																												   }
																																																																												   ```
																																																																												   Output:
																																																																												   ```
																																																																												   0
																																																																												   ```

																																																																												   #### s
																																																																												   The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																												   (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																												   from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																												   terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																												   Example `main.c`:
																																																																												   ```
																																																																												   int main(void)
																																																																												   {
																																																																												       _printf("# _printf :page_facing_up:

																																																																												       A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level
																																																																												       programming and algorithm track at ALX . The program is a pseudo-
																																																																												       recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

																																																																												       ## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																												       Th and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																												       zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																												       _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																												       with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																												       #### Flag Characters

																																																																												       The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																												       #### #
																																																																												         * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																													   with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																													     * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																													       * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																													       Example `main.c`:
																																																																													       ```
																																																																													       int main(void)
																																																																													       {
																																																																													           _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																														   }
																																																																														   ```
																																																																														   Output:
																																																																														   ```
																																																																														   0x7
																																																																														   ```

																																																																														   #### (space)
																																																																														     * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																														       signed conversion.

																																																																														       Example `main.c`:
																																																																														       ```
																																																																														       int main(void)
																																																																														       {
																																																																														           _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																															   }
																																																																															   ```
																																																																															   Output:
																																																																															   ```
																																																																															    7
																																																																															    ```

																																																																															    #### +
																																																																															      * A sign (`+` or `-`) is alwaytreet*, *city* and *state* are pointers to strings:

																																																																															      Example `main.c`:
																																																																															      ```
																																																																															      #include "holberton.h"

																																																																															      int main(void)
																																																																															      {
																																																																															      	char 23372036854775808           -> LONG_MIN
																																																																																```

																																																																																#### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function`0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																  * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																    * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																        _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																	}
																																																																																	```
																																																																																	Output:
																																																																																	```
																																																																																	0x7
																																																																																	```

																																																																																	#### (space)
																																																																																	  * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																	    signed conversion.

																																																																																	    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																	    ```
																																																																																	    int main(void)
																																																																																	    {
																																																																																	        _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																		}
																																																																																		```
																																																																																		Output:
																																																																																		```
																																																																																		 7
																																																																																		 ```

																																																																																		 #### +
																																																																																		   * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																		     conversion.
																																																																																		       * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																		       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																		       ```
																																																																																		       int main(void)
																																																																																		       {
																																																																																		           _printf("%+d\n", 7);
																																																																																			   }
																																																																																			   ```
																																																																																			   Output:
																																																																																			   ```
																																																																																			   +7
																																																																																			   ```

																																																																																			   #### 0
																																																																																			     * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																			       padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																			         * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																				   precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																				   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																				   ```
																																																																																				   int main(val
																																																																																				   with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																				   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																				   ```
																																																																																				   int main(void)
																																																																																				   {
																																																																																				       char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																				           _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																					   }
																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																					   Output:
																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																					   0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																					   ```

																																																																																					   #### %
																																																																																					   A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																					   specification is `%%`.

																																																																																					   Example:
																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																					   int main(void)
																																																																																					   {
																																																																																					       _printf("%%\n");
																																																																																					       }
																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																					       Output:
																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																					       %
																																																																																					       ```

																																																																																														  Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																														  For example, in the following:
																																																																																														  `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																														  the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																														  #### Precision

																																																																																														  After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																														  followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																														  conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																														  For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																														  to be printed.

																																																																																														  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																														  ```
																																																																																														  int main(void)
																																																																																														  {
																																																																																														      _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																														      }
																																																																																														      ```
																																																																																														      Output:
																																																																																														      `andard output. The function writes
																																																																																														      under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																														      (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																														      converted for output.

																																																																																														      Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																														      ### Return Value

																																																																																														      Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																														      (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																														      output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																																																																														      ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																														      The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																														      or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																														      to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																														      fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																														      introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																														      between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																														      zero or more _depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																														      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																														      ```
																																																																																														      int main(void)
																																																																																														      {
																																																																																														          _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																															  }
																																																																																															  ```
																																																																																															  Ouptut:
																																																																																															  ```
																																																																																															        7
																																																																																																```

																																																																																																Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																For example, in the following:
																																																																																																`_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																#### Precision

																																																																																																After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																to be printed.

																																																																																																Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																```
																																																																																																int main(void)
																																																																																																{
																																																																																																    _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																    }
																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																    Output:
																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																    0000007
																																																																																																    ```

																																																																																																    Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																    after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																    `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																    the argument `6` is consroW ,olleH
																																																																																																    ```

																																																																																																    #### R

																																																																																																    Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
																																																																																																    is converted to its corresponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																																																																																    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																    int main(void)
																																																																																																    {
																																																																																																        _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																	}
																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																	Output:
																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																	Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																																																	```

																																																																																																	#### p
																																																																																																	The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																																																	with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																	Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																	int main(void)
																																																																																																	{
																																																																																																	    char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																	        _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																																		}
																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																		Output:
																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																		0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																																		```

																																																																																																		#### %
																																																																																																		A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																		specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																		Example:
																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																		int main(void)
																																																																																																		{
																																																																																																		    _printf("%%\n");
																																																																																																		    }

																																																																																																				int main(void)
																																																																																																				{
																																																																																																				    _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																				    }
																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																				    Output:
																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																				    7
																																																																																																				    ```

																																																																																																				    #### b
																																																																																																				    The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																				    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																				    int main(ons, each of which results in
																																																																																																				    fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																				    introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																				    between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																				    zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																				    _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																				    with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																				    #### Flag Characters

																																																																																																				    The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																				    #### #
																																																																																																				      * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																				        with oid)
																																																																																																					{
																																																																																																					    _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																																																					    }
																																																																																																					    ```
																																																																																																					    Output:
																																																																																																					    ```
																																																																																																					    00007
																																																																																																					    ```

																																																																																																					    #### -
																																																																																																					      * The converted value is left-justified (padded on the right with blanks
																																																																																																					        instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																						  * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																						  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																						  ```
																																																																																																						  int main(void)
																																																																																																						  {
																																																																																																						      _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																						      }
																																																																																																						      ```
																																																																																																						      Output:
																																																																																																						      ```
																																																																																																						      7  in(void)
																																																																																																						      {
																																																																																																						          _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																																																							  }
																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																							  Output:
																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																							  0
																																																																																																							  ```

																																																																																																							  #### s
																																																																																																							  The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																							  (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																							  from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																							  terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																							  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																							  int main(void)
																																																																																																							  {
																																																																																																							      _printf("%s\n", "Hello, World!");
																																																																																																							      }
																																																																																																							      ```
																																																																																																							      Output:
																																																																																																							      ```
																																																																																																							      Hello, World!
																																																																																																							      ```

																																																																																																							      #### S
																																																																																																							      Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																							      in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																							      as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																							      characters).

																																																																																																							      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																							      ```
																																																																																																							      int main(void)
																																																																																																							      {
																																																																																																							          _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																								  }
																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																								  Output:
																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																								  Hello, World! \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
																																																																																																								  ```

																																																																																																								  r
																																																																																																								  Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characnt the values of `LONG_MAX` and `LONG_MIN` aligned and
																																																																																																								  left-justified with a width of 30:

																																																																																																								  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																								  #include "main.h"
																																																																																																								  #include <limits.h>

																																																																																																								  int main(void)
																																																																																																								  {
																																																																																																								  	_printf("% -30ld -> LONG_MAX\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																										_printf("%-30ld -> LONG_MIN\n", LONG_MIN);
																																																																																																										}
																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																										Output:
																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																										 9223372036854775807           -> LONG_MAX
																																																																																																										 -9223372036854775808           -> LONG_MIN

																																																																																																												 }
																																																																																																												 ```

																																																																																																												 Compilation:
																																																																																																												 ```
																																																																																																												 $ gcc *.c -o tester
																																																																																																												 ```

																																																																																																												 Output:
																																																																																																												 ```
																																																																																																												 $ ./tester
																																																																																																												 Hello, World!
																																																																																																												 $
																																																																																																												 ```

																																																																																																												 ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																																																												 The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																												 under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																												 (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																												 converted for output.

																																																																																																												 Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																												 ### Return Value

																																																																																																												 Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																												 (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																												 output error is encountered, th`
																																																																																																												 followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																												 conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																												 For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																												 to be printed.

																																																																																																												 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																												 ```
																																																																																																												 int main(void)
																																																																																																												 {
																																																																																																												     _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																												     }
																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																												     Output:
																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																												     0000007
																																																																																																												     ```

																																																																																																												     Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																												     after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																												     `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																												     the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																												     `1`.

																																																																																																												     #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																												     After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																												     following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																												     #### h
																																																																																																												     Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																												     `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																												     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																												     int main(void)
																																																																																																												     {
																																																																																																												         _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_MAX);
																																																																																																													 }
																																																																																																													 ```
																																																																																																													 Output:
																																																																																																													 ```
																																																																																																													 32767
																																																																																																													 ```

																																																																																																													 #### l
																																																																																																													 Specifies that
																																																																																																													     char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																													         _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																																														 }
																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																														 Output:
																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																														 0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																																														 ```

																																																																																																														 #### %
																																																																																																														 A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																														 specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																														 Example:
																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																														 int main(void)
																																																																																																														 {
																																																																																																														     _printf("%%\n");
																																																																																																														     }
																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																														     Output:
																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																														     %
																																																																																																														     ```

																																																																																																														     ## More Examples :thumbsup:

																																																																																																														     To print the address of Holberton School in the format "972 Mission St., San
																																																																																																														     Francisco, CA 94103" where *street*, *city* and *state* are pointers to strings:

																																																																																																														     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																														     #include "holberton.h"

																																																																																																														     int main(void)
																																																																																																														     {
																																																																																																														     	char *street = "Mission St.", *city = "San Francisco", *state = "CA";

																																																																																																																_printf("%d %s, %s, %s %d\n", 972, street, city, state, 94103);
																																																																																																																}
																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																Output:
																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																972 Mission St., San Francisco, CA 94103
																																																																																																																```

																																																																																																																To print the result of basic mathematical operations prepended by signs and
																																																																																																																all numbers printed with a minimum precision of two digits:

																																																																																																																Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																#include "holber, 77);
																																																																																																																}
																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																Output:
																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																115
																																																																																																																```

																																																																																																																#### c
																																																																																																																The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`.

																																																																																																																Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																int main(void)
																																																																																																																{
																																																																																																																    _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																																																																    }
																																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																																    Output:
																																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																																    0
																																																																																																																    ```

																																																																																																																    #### s
																																																																																																																    The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																																    (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																																    from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																    terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																    Example `main.c`:

																																																																																																																    int main(void)
																																																																																																																    {
																																																																																																																        _printf("%s\n", "Hello, World!");
																																																																																																																	}
																																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																																	Output:
																																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																																	Hello, World!
																																																																																																																	```

																																																																																																																	#### S
																																																																																																																	Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																	in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																	as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																	characters).

																																																																																																																	Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																																	int main(void)
																																																																																																																	{
																																																																																																																	    _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																																	    }
																																																																																																																	    ```
																																																																																																																	    Output:
																																																																																																																	    ```
																																																																																																																	    Hello, World! may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																	    The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																	    than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																	    (idered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																	    `1`.

																																																																																																																	    #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																	    After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																	    following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																	    #### h
																																																																																																																	    Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																	    `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																	    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																	    ```
																																																																																																																	    int main(void)
																																																																																																																	    {

																																																																																																																		    Output:
																																																																																																																		    ```
																																																																																																																		    9223372036854775807
																																																																																																																		    ```

																																																																																																																		    #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																		    The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																		    specay and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																		    terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																		    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																		    ```

																																																																																																																														 ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																														 The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero

																																																																																																																														 to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																														 fetching zero or more subsequent argum``
																																																																																																																														 0000007
																																																																																																																														 ```

																																																																																																																														 Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																														 after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																														 `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																														 the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																														 `1`.

																																																																																																																														 #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																														 After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																														 following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																														 #### h

																																																																																																																															     The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																															     under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																															     (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																															     converted for output.

																																																																																																																															     Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																															     ### Return Value

																																																																																																																															     Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																															     (excluding the terminating null byte useMAX);
																																																																																																																															     }
																																																																																																																															     ```
																																																																																																																															     Output:
																																																																																																																															     ```
																																																																																																																															     32767
																																																																																																																															     ```

																																																																																																																															     #### l
																																																																																																																															     Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																															     `unsigned long int` argument.

																																																																																																																															     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																															     ```
																																																																																																																															     int main(void)
																																																																																																																															     {
																																																																																																																															         _printf("%ld\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																																																 }
																																																																																																																																 ```
																																																																																																																																 Output:
																																																																																																																																 ```
																																																																																																																																 9223372036854775807
																																																																																																																																 ```

																																																																																																																																 #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																 The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																 specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																 supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																 #### d, i
																																																																																																																																 The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																 ```
																																																																																																																																 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																 {
																																																																																																																																     _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																     }
																																																																																																																																     ```
																																																																																																																																     Output:
																																																																																																																																     ```
																																																																																																																																     7
																																																																																																																																     ```

																																																																																																																																     #### b
																																																																																																																																     The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																     ```
																																																																																																																																     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																     {
																																																																																																																																         _printf("%b\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																	 }
																																																																																																																																	 ```
																																																																																																																																	 Output:
																																																																																																																																	 ```
																																																																																																																																	 111
																																																																																																																																	 ```

																																																																																																																																	 #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																	 The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																	 decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexad(./LICENSE) file for details.

																																																																																																																																	 ## Acknowledgements :pray:

																																																																																																																																	 The `_printf` function emulates functionality of the C standard library
																																																																																																																																	 function `printf`. This README borrows from the Linux man page
																																																																																																																																	 [printf(3)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf).s).

																																																																																																																																	 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																	 ```
																																																																																																																																	 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																	 {
																																																																																																																																	     _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																																																	     }
																																																																																																																																	     ```
																																																																																																																																	     Output:
																																																																																																																																	     ```
																																																																																																																																	     Hello, World! \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
																																																																																																																																	     ```

																																																																																																																																	     r
																																																																																																																																	     Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characters from the array
																																																																																																																																	     are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
																																																																																																																																	     byte (`\0`) and ending at the first element of the array.

																																																																																																																																	     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																	     ```
																																																																																																																																	     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																	     {
																																																																																																																																	         _printf("r\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																		 }
																																																																																																																																		 ```
																																																																																																																																		 Output:
																																																																																																																																		 ```
																																																																																																																																		 dlroW ,olleH
																																																																																																																																		 ```

																																																																																																																																		 #### R

																																																																																																																																		 Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
																																																																																																																																		 is converted to its corresponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																																																																																																																		 Example `main.c`peneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																		 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																		 ```
																																																																																																																																		 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																		 {
																																																																																																																																		     _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																		     }
																																																																																																																																		     ```
																																																																																																																																		     Output:
																																																																																																																																		     ```
																																																																																																																																		     0x7
																																																																																																																																		     ```

																																																																																																																																		     #### (space)
																																																																																																																																		       * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																		         signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																			 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																			 ```
																																																																																																																																			 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																			 {
																																																																																																																																			     _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																			     }
																																																																																																																																			     ```
																																																																																																																																			     Output:
																																																																																																																																			     ```
																																																																																																																																			      7
																																																																																																																																			      ```

																																																																																																																																			      #### +
																																																																																																																																			        * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																				  conversion.
																																																																																																																																				    * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																				    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																																																				    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																				    {
																																																																																																																																				        _printf("%+d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																					}
																																																																																																																																					```
																																																																																																																																					Output:
																																																																																																																																					```
																																																																																																																																					+7
																																																																																																																																					```

																																																																																																																																					#### 0
																																																																																																																																					  * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																																																																					    padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																																																																					      * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																					        precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																						Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																						```
																																																																																																																																						int main(void)
																																																																																																																																						{
																																																																																																																																						    _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																						    }
																																																																																																																																						    ```
																																																																																																																																						    Output:
																																																																																																																																						    ```
																																																																																																																																						    00007
																																																																																																																																						    ```

																																																																																																																																						    #### -
																																																																																																																																						      * The converted value is left-justified (padded o(void)
																																																																																																																																						      {
																																																																																																																																						          _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																																																																																							  }
																																																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																																																							  Output:
																																																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																																																							  0
																																																																																																																																							  ```

																																																																																																																																							  #### s
																																																																																																																																							  The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																																																							  (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																																																							  from the first element of the arre `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																																																																							  or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged

																																																																																																																																							  ## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																																																																																							  The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																							  ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																							  To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,

																																																																																																																																							      ```

																																																																																																																																							      #### b
																																																																																																																																							      The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																							      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																							      ```
																																																																																																																																							      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																							      {

																																																																																																																																								  }
																																																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																																																								  Output:
																																																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																																																								  111
																																																																																																																																								  ```

																																																																																																																																								  #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																								  The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																								  decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																								  used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																								  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																																																								  int main(void)
																																																																																																																																								  {
																																																																																																																																								      _printf("%o\n", 77);
																																																																																																																																								      }

																																																																																																																																								      #### c
																																																																																																																																								      The `int` argumentment using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																								      after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																								      `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																								      the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																								      `1`.

																																																																																																																																								      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																								      ```
																																																																																																																																								      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																								      {
																																																																																																																																								          _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_MAX);

																																																																																																																																									      The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																									      specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` functiontf("% -30ld -> LONG_MAX\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																																																									      	_printf("%-30ld -> LONG_MIN\n", LONG_MIN);
																																																																																																																																										}
																																																																																																																																										```

																																																																																																																																												 ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																												 The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero

																																																																																																																																																							 introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																							 between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																							 zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																							 _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond

																																																																																																																																																							 #### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																							 The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																							 #### #
																																																																																																																																																							   * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																							     with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																							       * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																							         * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																																								 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																								 ```
																																																																																																																																																								 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																								 {
																																																																																																																																																								     _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																								     }

																																																																																																																																																								     #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																								       * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																								         signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																									 Example `main.c`ifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																									 supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																									 #### d, i
																																																																																																																																																									 The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																									 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																									 ```
																																																																																																																																																									 int main(void)

																																																																																																																																																									     7
																																																																																																																																																									     ```

																																																																																																																																																									     #### b
																																																																																																																																																									     The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																									     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																									     ```
																																																																																																																																																									     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																									     {

																																																																																																																																																										 }
																																																																																																																																																										 ```
																																																																																																																																																										 Output:
																																																																																																																																																										 ```

																																																																																																																																																										 #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																										 The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																																										 decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																																										 used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																										 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																										 ```
																																																																																																																																																										 int main(void)

																																																																																																																																																																	Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																																																																																	int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																	{
																																																																																																																																																																	    _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");

																																																																																																																																																																	    ## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																																																																																																																	    The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																																																	    ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																	    To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
																																																																																																																																																																	    compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
																																																																																																																																																																	    any main function.

																																																																																																																																																																	    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																	    ```
																																																																																																																																																																	    #include "main.h"

																																																																																																																																																																	    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																	    {
																																																																																																																																																																	        _printf("Hello, World!");

																																																																																																																																																																		    return (0);
																																																																																																																																																																		    }
																																																																																																																																																																		    ```

																																																																																																																																																																		    Compilation:
																																																																																																																																																																		    ```
																																																																																																																																																																		    $ gcc *.c -o tester
																																																																																																																																																																		    ```

																																																																																																																																																																		    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																		    ```
																																																																																																																																																																		    $ ./tester
																																																																																																																																																																		    Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																		    $
																																																																																																																																																																		    ```

																																																																																																																																																																		    ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																																																																																																																		    The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																		    under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																		    (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																		    converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																		    Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																		    ### If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																		      precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																		      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																		      ```
																																																																																																																																																																		      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																		      {
																																																																																																																																																																		          _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																			  }
																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																			  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																			  00007
																																																																																																																																																																			  ```

																																																																																																																																																																			  #### -
																																																																																																																																																																			    * The converted value is left-justified (padded on the right with blanks
																																																																																																																																																																			      instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																																																																																			        * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																				Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																				```
																																																																																																																																																																				int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																				{
																																																																																																																																																																				    _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																				    }
																																																																																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																																																																																				    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																																																																																				    7    7
																																																																																																																																																																				    ```

																																																																																																																																																																				    #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																				    After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																				    The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																																																																				    than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																																																																				    (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																				    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																				    ```
																																																																																																																																																																				    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																				    {
																																																																																																																																																																				        _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																					}
																																																																																																																																																																					```
																																																																																																																																																																					Ouptut:
																																																																																																																																																																					```
																																																																																																																																																																					      7
																																																																																																																																																																					      ```

																																																																																																																																																																					      Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																					      For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																					      `_ any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																					      in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																					      as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																					      characters).

																																																																																																																																																																					      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																					      ```
																																																																																																																																																																					      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																					      {
																																																																																																																																																																					          _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																																																																																						  }
																																																																																																																																																																						  ```
																																																																																																																																																																						  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																						  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																									    #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																									    After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																									    followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`

																																																																																																																																																																																										Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																										after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																										`_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																										the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																										`1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																										#### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																										After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																										following length modifiers may be pro
																																																																																																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																																																																																																										int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																										{
																																																																																																																																																																																										    _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World") For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																																																																																																																										      padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																																																																																																																										        * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																																											  precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																																											  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																											  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																											  int main(ve `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																																																																											  ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																																											  To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed, of zero
																																																																																																																																																																																											  or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																											  to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																																																																																											  fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																											  introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																											  between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																											  zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																											  _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																											  wiending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																											  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																											  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																											  int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																											  {
																																																																																																																																																																																											      _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																											      }
																																																																																																																																																																																											      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																											      Ouptut:
																																																																																																																																																																																											      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																											            7
																																																																																																																																																																																												    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																												    Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																												    For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																												    `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																												    the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																												    #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																												    After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `. an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																												    `unsigned long int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																												    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																												    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																												    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																												    {
																																																																																																																																																																																												        _printf("%ld\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																													}
																																																																																																																																																																																													```
																																																																																																																																																																																													Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																													```
																																																																																																																																																																																													9223372036854775807
																																																																																																																																																																																													```

																																																																																																																																																																																													#### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																													The conversion spe# _printf :page_facing_up:

																																																																																																																																																																																													A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level
																																																																																																																																																																																													programming and algorithm track at ALX . The program is a pseudo-
																																																																																																																																																																																													recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

																																																																																																																																																																																													## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																																																																																																																																													The  any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																													followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																													conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																													For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																													to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																													Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																													```
																																																																																																																																																																																													int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																													{
																																																																																																																																																																																													    _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																													    }
																																																																																																																																																																																													    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																													    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																													    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																													    0000007
																																																																																																																																																																																													    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																													    Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																													    after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																													    `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																													    the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																													    `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																													    #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																													    After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																													    following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																													    #### h
																																																																																																																																																																																													    Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																													    `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																													    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																													    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																													    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																													    {
																																																																																																																																																																																													        _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_Mons and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																																																														Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																														```
																																																																																																																																																																																														int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																														{
																																																																																																																																																																																														    _printf("%o\n", 77);
																																																																																																																																																																																														    }
																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																														    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																														    115
																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																														    #### c
																																																																																																																																																																																														    The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`.

																																																																																																																																																																																														    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																														    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																														    {
																																																																																																																																																																																														        _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																																																																																																																																															}
																																																																																																																																																																																															```
																																																																																																																																																																																															Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																															```
																																																																																																																																																																																															0
																																																																																																																																																																																															```

																																																																																																																																																																																															#### s
																																																																																																																																																																																															The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																																																																																																															(aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																																																																																																															from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																																																																																															terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																																																																																															Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																															```
																																																																																																																																																																																															int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																															{
																																																																																																																																																																																															    _printf("%s\n", "Hello, World!");
																																																																																																																																																																																															    }
																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																															    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																															    Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																															    #### S
																																																																																																																																																																																															    Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																																															    in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																															    as `\x` followed by th and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																															    ### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																															    The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																															    #### #
																																																																																																																																																																																															      * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																															        with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																  * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																																																																    * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																																																																																    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																        _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																	}
																																																																																																																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																																																																																																																	Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																	```

																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																		 7
																																																																																																																																																																																																		 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																		 #### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																		   * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																																																																																		     conversion.
																																																																																																																																																																																																		       * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																		       Example `main.c`:

																																																																																																																																																																																																					     with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																					     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																					     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																					     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																					     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																					         char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																																																																																																																						     _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																						     #### %
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     A `% for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																						     #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																						     After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																						     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																						     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																						         _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 0000007
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 #### h
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Example `mainm completed as part of the low-level
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 programming and algorithm track at ALX . The program is a pseudo-
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 any main function.

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 #include "main.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																							 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																							 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																							     _printf("Hello, World!");

																																																																																																																																																																																																							         return (0);
																																																																																																																																																																																																								 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																								 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																								 Compilation:
																																																																																																																																																																																																								 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																								 $ gcc *.c -o tester

																																																																																																																																																																																																								 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																								     _printf("Hello, World!");

																																																																																																																																																																																																								         return (0);
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 Compilation:
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 $ gcc *.c -o tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 $ ./tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 $
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ### Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which a854775807
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 #### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																									 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																									 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     7
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																									     #### b
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																									     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																									     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																									         _printf("%b\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 111
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																										 #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																																																																										 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																										 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     _printf("%o\n", 77);
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     115
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																										     #### c
																																																																																																																																																																																																										     The `int` argument or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																										     #### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																										       * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																																										         with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																											   * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																																																																											     * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																																																																																											     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																											     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																											     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																											     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																											         _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																												 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																												 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																												 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																												 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																												 0x7
																																																																																																																																																																																																												 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																												 #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																																																																												   * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																																																																												     signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																												     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																												     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																												         _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																													 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																													 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																													 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																													 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																													  7
																																																																																																																																																																																																													  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																													  #### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																													    * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																																																																																													      conversion.
																																																																																																																																																																																																													        * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																														Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																														```
																																																																																																																																																																																																														int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																														{
																																																																																																																																																																																																														    _printf("%+d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																														    }

																																																																																																																																																																																																														    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																														    +7
																																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																														    #### 0
																																																																																																																																																																																																														      * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																																																																																																																																														        padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      ### Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed oes).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										        * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    7    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											        _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												Ouptut:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of di \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      r
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characters from the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      byte (`\0`) and ending at the first element of the array.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												          _printf("r\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													  Output:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													  {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      #### p

The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													      with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	  The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		`_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		#### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						#### S
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						characters).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    _printf("%S\n"f the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						      precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						          _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  00007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  #### -
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							    * The converted value is left-justified (padded on the right with blanks
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							        * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    7    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								        _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									Ouptut:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      `_prin and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      #### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      #### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									        * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										  with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										          _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  0x7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											  #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											      signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											          _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												   7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												   #### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												       conversion.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												         * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     _Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     #### h
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													         _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 32767
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 #### l
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 `unsigned long int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     _printf("%ld\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     9223372036854775807
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     #### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														         _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															 street = "Mission St.", *city = "San Francisco", *state = "CA";

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															 	_printf("%d %s, %s, %s %d\n", 972, street, city, state, 94103);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																972 Mission St., San Francisco, CA 94103
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																To print the result of basic mathematical operations prepended by signs and
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																all numbers printed with a minimum precision of two digits:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																#include "holberton.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	_printf("%.2d + %.2d = %+.2d\n", 1, 2, 1 + 2);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		_printf("%d - %d = %+d\n", 10, 20, 10 - 20);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		01 + 02 = +03
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		10 - 20 = -10
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		To print the values of `LONG_MAX` and `LONG_MIN` aligned and
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		left-justified with a width of 30:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		#include "main.h"
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		#include <limits.h>

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			_printf("% -30ld -> LONG_MAX\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				_printf("%-30ld -> LONG_MIN\n", LONG_MIN);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 9223372036854775807           -> LONG_MAX
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 -9223tf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 any main function.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 #include "main.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     _printf("Hello, World!");

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				         return (0);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Compilation:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 $ gcc *.c -o tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 $ ./tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 $
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ### Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Thd `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     0000007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     #### h
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					         _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 32767
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 #### l
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 `unsigned long i\n", "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 Hello, World! \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 r
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characters from the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 byte (`\0`) and ending at the first element of the array.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     _printf("r\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     dlroW ,olleH
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     #### R

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     is converted to its corresponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						         _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 #### p
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     #### %
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     Example:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     {

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 # _printf :page_facing_up:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 A formatted output conversion C progra# Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 #### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												   * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												       * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												         * For `X` conversions, `0X` is pren the right with blanks
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													   instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													         _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 7    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 After flags, a minimum field widthifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 #### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     Outpudard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ### Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     zero or more _flepending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														         _printf("%7d\n", 7);

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															           _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   0000007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   the argument `6` is considW ,olleH
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   #### R

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   is converted to its corresponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																   {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       #### p
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																           char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       #### %
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       Example:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	           _printf("%%\n");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   %

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `mainre copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   zero or more _flaged the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   #### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   #### h
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   `unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			       0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			       #### s
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			       The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									9223372036854775807
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									#### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									#### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    #### b
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									        _printf("%b\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										111
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										#### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    _printf("%o\n", 77
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    #### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    The character `%` may be followed by zerointf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits tons and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										        _printf("%o\n", 77);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											115
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											#### c
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    #### s
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											        _printf("%s\n", "Hello, World!");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												#### S
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												characters).t ALX . The program is a pseudo-
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    Output:r conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    `unsigned long int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    {

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	_precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	#### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	#### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	  * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepen 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      n-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	        * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    _printf("%#x\n", 7);

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    0x7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		        signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			i)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    _printf("%b\n", 7);

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    111
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    The `unsigned int` argument is converted toASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    characters).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			        _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World!

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Hello, World! \x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFCE\x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFA0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				r
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except characters from the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				byte (`\0`) and ending at the first elemat "972 Mission St., San
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Francisco, CA 94103" where *street*, *city* and *state* are pointers to strings:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Example `main.c`:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				#include "holberton.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				{

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						_printf("%d %s, %s, %s %d\n", 972, street, city, stawing:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						`_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						`1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						#### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						#### h
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `short int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						`unsigned short int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    _printf("%hd\n", SHRT_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    32767
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    #### l
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    `unsigned long int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						        _printf("%ld\n", LONG_MAX);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							9223372036854775807
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							#### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							#### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							The `inction returns `-1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							_precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							#ed value is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							    * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							          _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  00007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  The `_printf` function emulates functionality of the C standard library
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  function `printf`. This README borrows from the Linux man page
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  [printf(3)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      Ouptut:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								            7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X, "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    Hello, World! ` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    Example:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									        _printf("%%\n");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										%
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										  * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										    padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										      * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										        precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												#### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									         instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       }

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										           _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											   }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											         7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 the argument `6` is considered the width fohe array are written starting
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     _printf("%s\n", "Hello, World!");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     #### S
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, exceptd");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     #### p
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												         char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     #### %
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     Example:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													         _printf("%%\n");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														 Output:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    #the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    #### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														        _printf("%d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															#### b
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															{
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    _printf("%b\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    }

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    111
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    used for `x` conversions and the letters `ABCDEF` are used for `X` conversions.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															        _printf("%o\n", 77);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																}

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																115
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																#### c
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    programming and algorithm track at ALX . The program is a pseudo-
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    ## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    any main function.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    #include "main.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																        _printf("Hello, World!");

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    $ gcc *.c -o tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    Output:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    $ ./tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    $
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    ## Description :spe```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	        _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		Ouptut:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      int ma from the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      are written in reverse, starting from, but not including, the terminating null
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      byte (`\0`) and ending at the first element of the array.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		          _printf("r\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  dlroW ,olleH
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  #### R

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except each character of the array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  is converted to its corresponding character in ROT13 before being written.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      _printf("%R\n", "Hello, World");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      Uryyb, Jbeyq
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      #### p
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      The address of the argument is written. The address is written in hexadecimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      with a leading `0x`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			          char *str = "Hello, World";

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      0x561a6d7bab5d
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      #### %
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      A `%` is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      specification is `%%`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      Example:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      {

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  To use the `_prine `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  ##

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  #### S
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  characters).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					  {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					      _printf("%S *)str);

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	          _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  0x7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		          _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			   7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			   #### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			       conversion.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			         * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     _printf("%+d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     }

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       ## Dependencies :couple:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       ## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installo\n", 77);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       }

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       115
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       #### c
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				           _printf("%c\n", 48);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   #### s
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       _printf("%s\n", "Hello, World!");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       #### S
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       characters).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					           _printf("%S\n", "Hello, World! Π");
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   Hello, Wariable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ### Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   output error is encountered, the fun#### -
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     * The converted value is left-justified (padded on the right with blanks
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						         * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     7    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     than the provided width, the output is padded on the left or right with spaces
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     (depending on whether the `-` flag was provided).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							         _printf("%7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								 }

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														#### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The `_printf` function
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														supports the following conversion specifiers:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														#### d, i
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														Examp consider and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														Example `main.c`:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    #### S
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    Identical to the `s` conversion specifier, except any non-printable characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    in the array (ie. characters with an ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are written
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    as `\x` followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case, two
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    characters).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														    int main(void)

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    Emposed of zeroo appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															        _printf("%.7d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																0000007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																`_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																`1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																#### Length Modifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																After flags, width, and precision and before a conversion specifier, one of the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																following length modifiers may be provided:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																#### h
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Specifies that an integer conversion correspond#able-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																### Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																(excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																output error is enco followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																#### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																  * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																    with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																      * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepn.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																      int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																          _printf("Hello, World!");

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      return (0);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      Compilation:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      $ gcc *.c -o tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      $ ./tester
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      Hello, World!
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      $
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      ## Description :speech_balloon:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      converted for ouargument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, cifies that an integent main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	      {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	          _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		  ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		   #### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		     * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		       conversion.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		         * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			 Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			 int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			 {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     _printf("%+d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     +7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			     #### 0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			       * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			         padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				   * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				     {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				         _printf("%05d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 00007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					 #### -
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   * The converted value is left-justified (padded on the right with blanks
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     instead of on the left with blanks or zeroes).
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       * Overrides a `0` flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					           _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   7    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   #### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   After flags, a minim the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   _precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   #### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   #### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						     * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       with `0` if it was not zero already.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						         * For `x` converions, `0x` is prepended for non-zero numbers.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   * For `X` conversions, `0X` is prepeneded for non-zero numbers.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       _printf("%#x\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       0x7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							       #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							         * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								   signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								   Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								   int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								   {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       _printf("% d\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       }
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       Output:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								        7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									#### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									  * A sign (`+l
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									  Specifies that an integer conversion corresponds to a `long int` or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									  `unsigned long int` argument.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									  Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									  ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      specifies #### s
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      The `const char *` argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      (aka. pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written starting
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      from the first element of the array and ending at, but not including, the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      terminating null byte (`\0`).

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									      int main(void)

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															_precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															#### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															The character `%` may be`o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 4.8.4.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	## Usage :running:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	any main function.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	#include "main.h"

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	{

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    converted for output.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		    Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      #### Conversion Specifiers

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				      The conversion specifier (introduced by the character `%`) is a character that

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       Alternatively, width may be provied as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       `_printf("%*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       the argument `6` is considered the width for the conversion of the decimal `1`.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       #### Precision

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       After any flags or provided width, a precision may be specified by a `.`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       followed by a decimal digit string. For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       conversions, the precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       For `s` and `S` conversions, the precision specifies the maximum characters
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       to be printed.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						       {

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   0000007
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   Alternatively, precision may be provided as an argument using the `*` character
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   after the `.`. For example, in the following:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   `_printf("%.*d\n", 6, 1);`
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							   the argument `6` is considered the precision for the conversion of the decimal

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       #### b
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								       The `unsigned int` argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   #### o, u, x, X
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   decimal (`u`), or unsigned hexadecimal (`x` and `X`). The letters `abcdef` are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   used for `x` conversiwith the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   #### Flag Characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   The character `%` may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									   #### #
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									     * For `o` conversions, the first character of the output string is prefixed

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   ## Author## Return Value

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   ### Format of the Argument String

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										   to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													    Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													    ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													    int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													    {
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													        _printf("%-5d7\n", 7);
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														#### Field Width

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														After flags, a minimum field width may be specified by a decimal digit string
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														The first digit must be non-zero. If the converted value has fewer characters

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   0x7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					   #### (space)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					     * A blank is left before a positive number or empty string produced by a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       signed conversion.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       Example `main.c`:
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       int main(void)
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					       {

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						   ```
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    7
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						    #### +
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						      * A sign (`+` or `-`) is always placed before a number produced by signed
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						        conversion.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							  * Overrides a space flag.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      ```

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							      #### 0
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							        * For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the converted value is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								  padded on the left with zeroes rather than blanks.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								    * If the `0` flag is provided to a numeric conversion with a specified
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      precision, it is ignored.

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								      Example `main.c`:
